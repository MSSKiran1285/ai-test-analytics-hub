# AI Test Analytics Hub (TARH)

A cloud-native, serverless AI/ML platform for test analytics and defect risk prediction,
built on AWS.

## Phase 0 – Local ML Prototype

Goals:
- Use synthetic test case and defect data.
- Explore patterns via EDA.
- Prepare data and baseline ML model for test case risk prediction.
- Keep all code, data samples, and docs under source control.

## Repository Structure (current focus)

- `data/` – sample test & defect CSV files (non-sensitive).
- `ml/` – notebooks and scripts for EDA and model experiments.
- `docs/` – project documentation and planning notes.
- `infra/` – reserved for AWS IaC (later phases).
- `backend/` – reserved for Lambda/API code (later phases).
- `frontend/` – reserved for React UI (later phases).
